# GCT Coding Contest

This are the problems for the coding contest for my department's ITE Day hosted on May 5, 2024. You can solve this if you want to.

## Testing Solutions

Use the command `./gradlew cleanTest test` in your IDE terminal to test your solution.

## Benchmarking Solutions

Most of the problems use JMH for benchmarking your solution to the "fastest" within the jmh testing files. Use `./gradlew jmh` to benchmark your solution.
