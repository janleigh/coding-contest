## Is N a prime number? [EASY]

A [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is a natural number greater than $1$ that has no positive divisors other than $1$ or itself.

Write a function that takes an integer as an input, $n$, and returns a logical value of `true` or `false` depending if the integer is a prime.

Input:
```java
<IsPrimeNumber>.isPrime(1); // Output: false
<IsPrimeNumber>.isPrime(2); // Output: true
```
